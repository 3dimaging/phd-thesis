\chapter{Variable importances}\label{ch:importances}

% a forest of tree is impenetrable as far as simple interpretations of its mechanims go (Breiman, RF)


An important task in many scientific fields is the prediction of  a response
variable based on a set of predictor variables. In many situations though, the
aim is not only to make the most accurate predictions of the response but also
to identify which predictor variables are the most important to make these
predictions, e.g. in order to understand the underlying process. Because of
their applicability to a wide range of problems and their capability to both
build accurate models and, at the same time, to provide variable importance
measures, Random Forests~\citep{breiman:2001} and variants such as Extremely
Randomized Trees~\citep{geurts:2006} have become a major data analysis tool
used with success in various scientific areas.

% Despite their extensive use in applied research, only a couple of works have
% studied the theoretical properties and statistical mechanisms of these
% algorithms. \citet{zhao2000new}, \citet{breiman2004consistency},
% \citet{biau2008consistency,biau2012analysis}, \citet{meinshausen2006quantile}
% and \citet{lin2006random} investigated simplified to very realistic variants of
% these algorithms and proved  the consistency of those variants. Little is known
% however regarding the variable importances computed by Random Forests like
% algorithms, and -- as far as we know -- the work of~\citet{ishwaran2007variable}
% is indeed the only theoretical study of tree-based variable importance measures.

% In this work, we aim at filling this gap and present a theoretical  analysis of
% the Mean Decrease Impurity importance derived from ensembles of randomized
% trees. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in
% section~\ref{sec:background}, we provide  the background about ensembles of
% randomized trees and recall how variable importances can be derived from them;
% in section~\ref{sec:var-imp}, we then derive a characterization in asymptotic
% conditions and show how variable importances derived from totally randomized
% trees offer a three-level decomposition of the information jointly contained in
% the input variables about the output; section~\ref{sec:rel} shows that this
% characterization only depends on the relevant variables and
% section~\ref{sec:variants} discusses theses ideas in the context of variants
% closer to the Random Forest algorithm; section~\ref{sec:example} then
% illustrates all these ideas on an artificial problem; finally,
% section~\ref{sec:conclusions} includes our conclusions and proposes directions
% of future works.
