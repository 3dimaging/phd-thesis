% perspective/ Because when we sit down and think about a problem, when we
% take the time to not only understand what our feature space “is” and what it
% “implies” in the real-world — then we are acting like machine learning
% scientists. Otherwise, we just a bunch of machine learning engineers,
% blindly performing black box learning and operating a set of R, MATLAB, and
% Python libraries. The takeaway is this: machine learning isn’t a tool. It’s
% a methodology with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on
% the problem we are trying to solve. We shouldn’t blindly apply algorithms
% and see what sticks. We need to sit down, explore the feature space (both
% empirically and in terms of real-world implications), and then consider our
% best mode of action.
